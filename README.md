## Acknowledgement

Much of the inspiration and formulas for Fragmentarium came from the community at Fractal Forums, including Tom Beddard, Jan Kadlec, Iñigo Quilez, Buddhi, Jesse, and others. Special thanks goes out to Knighty and Kali for their great fragments. All fragments should include information about their origins - please notify me, if I made any mis-attributions.
